# NavigationDrawer

The primary objective of the application is to track the user’s location and display it with a location marker on Google maps. The user can create an account for access to the application, thereby protecting his privacy. Subsequently, on logging in, the user can see his current location on the map as well as previous locations’ history that are retrieved from a local database. Not only that, in case you lose your phone that app would send mail with the last known location as soon as the battery hits below critical level.
